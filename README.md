# Hello-world
Repository to learn GitHub, in preparation for developing a test-driven SharePoint self-learning system

My first career was as a lawyer (about 10 years).  Due to economic circumstances, I emigrated from my birth country and started a second career as a high-tech contracts manager (again, about 10 years).  I changed careers again and became a SharePoint developer when I learned how powerful SharePoint is to allow knowledge workers to automate their own processes without having to learn a programming language first. SharePoint has allowed me to make a high-level career change and essentially get paid for learning new skills.  

What I mean is that I was making roughly $45 an hour before my career change and was able to start a new, vastly different career without my earnings ever dipping below the $45 per hour mark. I did go for a couple of months at the beginning of my career change without any income while I was seeking paid work. My first paid gig was a half-time gig, but it allowed me to continue increasing my skills while bringing in enough to live on. My first full-time gig started less than 14 months after leaving my prior career, and I have never been out of full-time work for more than 6 weeks at a time since then, and since that time, I have never made less than $45 per hour and have made as much as $70 per hour. 

I was very blessed to be able to make such a drastic career change with little financial impact to my life, and would like to pay it forward by helping others learn how to become SharePoint power users and developers, and earn while they learn, if that is a career path that interests them. 

Although I have had the pleasure of mentoring several others on an individual basis, my efforts to create an automated system for rapid SharePoint learning have not been as successful as I would have wished. 

Upon discovering FreeCodeCamp.com, I determined a) to improve my programming skills to increase my earning power, and b) to work at developing a test-driven training system similar to FreeCodeCamp for teaching basic and advanced SharePoint skills.

As a direct result of improving my coding skills, I expect to be able to increase my earning to $80 per hour and up.
